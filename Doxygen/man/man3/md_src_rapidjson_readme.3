.SS "Introduction"
RapidJSON is a JSON parser and generator for C++\&. It was inspired by \fCRapidXml\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
RapidJSON is \fBsmall\fP but \fBcomplete\fP\&. It supports both SAX and DOM style API\&. The SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
RapidJSON is \fBfast\fP\&. Its performance can be comparable to \fCstrlen()\fP\&. It also optionally supports SSE2/SSE4\&.2 for acceleration\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
RapidJSON is \fBself-contained\fP and \fBheader-only\fP\&. It does not depend on external libraries such as BOOST\&. It even does not depend on STL\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
RapidJSON is \fBmemory-friendly\fP\&. Each JSON value occupies exactly 16 bytes for most 32/64-bit machines (excluding text string)\&. By default it uses a fast memory allocator, and the parser allocates memory compactly during parsing\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
RapidJSON is \fBUnicode-friendly\fP\&. It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (LE & BE), and their detection, validation and transcoding internally\&. For example, you can read a UTF-8 file and let RapidJSON transcode the JSON strings into UTF-16 in the DOM\&. It also supports surrogates and '\\u0000' (null character)\&.

.PP
JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a light-weight data exchange format\&. RapidJSON should be in full compliance with RFC7159/ECMA-404, with optional support of relaxed syntax\&. More information about JSON can be obtained at

.IP "\(bu" 2
Reduce memory overhead of each \fCValue\fP from 24 bytes to 16 bytes in x86-64 architecture\&.

.SS "Compatibility"
RapidJSON is cross-platform\&. Some platform/compiler combinations which have been tested are shown as follows\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Visual C++ 2008/2010/2013 on Windows (32/64-bit)
.IP "\(bu" 2
GNU C++ 3\&.8\&.x on Cygwin
.IP "\(bu" 2
Clang 3\&.4 on Mac OS X (32/64-bit) and iOS
.IP "\(bu" 2
Clang 3\&.4 on Android NDK
.PP
.PP
Users can build and run the unit tests on their platform/compiler\&.
.SS "Installation"
RapidJSON is a header-only C++ library\&. Just copy the \fCinclude/rapidjson\fP folder to system or project's include path\&.
.PP
Alternatively, if you are using the \fCvcpkg\fP dependency manager you can download and install rapidjson with CMake integration in a single command:
.IP "\(bu" 2
vcpkg install rapidjson
.PP
.PP
RapidJSON uses following software as its dependencies:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCCMake\fP as a general build tool
.IP "\(bu" 2
(optional) \fCDoxygen\fP to build documentation
.IP "\(bu" 2
(optional) \fCgoogletest\fP for unit and performance testing
.PP
.PP
To generate user documentation and run tests please proceed with the steps below:
.PP
.IP "1." 4
Execute \fCgit submodule update --init\fP to get the files of thirdparty submodules (google test)\&.
.IP "2." 4
Create directory called \fCbuild\fP in rapidjson source directory\&.
.IP "3." 4
Change to \fCbuild\fP directory and run \fCcmake \&.\&.\fP command to configure your build\&. Windows users can do the same with cmake-gui application\&.
.IP "4." 4
On Windows, build the solution found in the build directory\&. On Linux, run \fCmake\fP from the build directory\&.
.PP
.PP
On successful build you will find compiled test and example binaries in \fCbin\fP directory\&. The generated documentation will be available in \fCdoc/html\fP directory of the build tree\&. To run tests after finished build please run \fCmake test\fP or \fCctest\fP from your build tree\&. You can get detailed output using \fCctest -V\fP command\&.
.PP
It is possible to install library system-wide by running \fCmake install\fP command from the build tree with administrative privileges\&. This will install all files according to system preferences\&. Once RapidJSON is installed, it is possible to use it from other CMake projects by adding \fCfind_package(RapidJSON)\fP line to your CMakeLists\&.txt\&.
.SS "Usage at a glance"
This simple example parses a JSON string into a document (DOM), make a simple modification of the DOM, and finally stringify the DOM to a JSON string\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
// rapidjson/example/simpledom/simpledom\&.cpp`
#include "rapidjson/document\&.h"
#include "rapidjson/writer\&.h"
#include "rapidjson/stringbuffer\&.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace rapidjson;

int main() {
    // 1\&. Parse a JSON string into DOM\&.
    const char* json = "{\"project\":\"rapidjson\",\"stars\":10}";
    Document d;
    d\&.Parse(json);

    // 2\&. Modify it by DOM\&.
    Value& s = d["stars"];
    s\&.SetInt(s\&.GetInt() + 1);

    // 3\&. Stringify the DOM
    StringBuffer buffer;
    Writer<StringBuffer> writer(buffer);
    d\&.Accept(writer);

    // Output {"project":"rapidjson","stars":11}
    std::cout << buffer\&.GetString() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
