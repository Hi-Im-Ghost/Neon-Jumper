This file can be used as a \fCVisual Studio Visualizer\fP to aid in visualizing rapidjson structures within the Visual Studio debugger\&. Natvis visualizers are supported in Visual Studio 2012 and later\&. To install, copy the file into this directory:
.PP
\fCUSERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2012\\Visualizers\fP
.PP
Each version of Visual Studio has a similar directory, it must be copied into each directory to be used with that particular version\&. In Visual Studio 2015 and later, this can be done without restarting Visual Studio (a new debugging session must be started)\&.
